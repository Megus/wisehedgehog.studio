Stewart is not a lucky guy. Not only he was born as a snail far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy, but once upon a time, he woke up in a mysterious dungeon from which, it would seem, there is no way out. However, he found out that he can clear the way by eating colored pills lying here and there. It's a pity that there is so little space in the stomachâ€¦
